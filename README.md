# _Word Play_

#### _A form where a user can enter a sentence and see it reversed, 08.14.2017_

#### By _**Margaret Berry and Nate McGregor**_

## Description
_The end goal of the project was to take a sentence from the user, remove all words with fewer than three letters, and return those words in reverse order. Currently, the program only splits the sentence into individual words._

## Setup/Installation Requirements
_Run the following commands in Terminal:_

1. `$ git clone` [this repository](https://github.com/codemargaret/wordplay.git)
2. `$ cd wordplay`
3. `$ open index.html`

## Project Goals
* _Practice writing JavaScript functions and using arrays._

## Specifications
| Spec                                                      | Input                     | Output             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| A sentence will be reversed, with small words eliminated. | Hello, my name is Awesome | Awesome name Hello |

## Future Features
_Remove words longer than three letters and reverse the sentence._
